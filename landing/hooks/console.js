This website was built using Next.js: https://nextjs.org/, and is heavily
inspired by https://ioi.dk 's website.

I wanted to use the new CSS feature @scroll-timeline, but sadly
it is not yet supported in most browsers. That's why the scrolling
animations are triggered using JS. A scroll listener sets the current
x and y values as CSS variables, and the rest is handled using pure CSS.

Safari throttles the scroll event, so the animations are not smooth at all.
Moreover Safari does not fully support the CSS properties used here.
For example the gradient background is using a SVG CSS Filter to add the
grainy effect, and although Safari does end up displaying it correctly,
you can see the noise before the filter is applied for a split second.
I also had to inset a clip of 1px because the background-clip: text property
has an extra pixel that creates a gradient border.

The navigation animations are also handled using CSS, however the timing
is controlled on JavaScript. A custom front-end router handles the url
and triggers the navigation. Once the "page" has floated away, the site
renders the incoming page, teleports the div to the other side of the
page and slides it from the right. I wanted to use Next.js' static pages
to perform the navigation but cold not find a way to perform the animations
if I did that, if you have any idea how please contact me!
